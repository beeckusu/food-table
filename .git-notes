# Git Workflow Notes

## Merging main into feature branches

When merging main into any feature branch, use the DEFAULT merge message only.
Do NOT write custom merge commit messages.

Example:
```bash
git merge main
# Use default message: "Merge branch 'main' into <branch-name>"
```

## Handling Migration Conflicts

When merging main and there are migration conflicts:

**DO NOT** merge the two migrations together.

**DO** rename your current migration to be the next migration in the sequence.

Example:
- main has: 0001_initial.py
- Your branch has: 0001_initial.py
- Conflict occurs

Solution:
1. Keep main's 0001_initial.py as-is
2. Rename your branch's 0001_initial.py to 0002_<descriptive_name>.py
3. Update the dependencies in your renamed migration to depend on 0001_initial

This keeps the migration history linear and avoids merge conflicts in migration files.
